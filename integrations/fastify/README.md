This package is part of a wider suite of open-source API tools which power the Eject platform and correspondingly developed Eject applications. They encourage faster and stricter API development in accordance with our engineering mantra of "build with, not on".

Want to know more about the Eject platform and how it can help you collaboratively build best in class APIs? Head over to [eject.tech](https://eject.tech). Have questions or want to chat to us about the project? Reach out to us on Twitter [@geteject](https://twitter.com/geteject) or use our contact form [eject.tech/contact](https://eject.tech/contact).

**These tools are still in active development and subject to a first release, there will be ongoing breaking changes until then. Sign up to our waitlist at [eject.tech](https://eject.tech) to be notified of product updates.**

## Eject Fastify Integration

The Eject Fastify integration provides a straight forward means of integrating Eject with Fastify.

It exposes two Fastify plugins:

- `interface`: Initialization plugin for the specification generator.
- `routes`: Route-loader plugin for Ejects preferred approach of file-based routing.

To see how these work, we recommend taking a look at our [TypeScript starter](https://github.com/eject-tech/eject/tree/main/starters/typescript) for now.

### Work in progress

We're still working on these tools! Sign up to our waitlist at [eject.tech](https://eject.tech) to be notified of product updates.
