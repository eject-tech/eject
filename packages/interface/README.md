This package is part of a wider suite of open-source API tools which power the Eject platform and correspondingly developed Eject applications. They encourage faster and stricter API development in accordance with our engineering mantra of "build with, not on".

Want to know more about the Eject platform and how it can help you collaboratively build best in class APIs? Head over to [eject.tech](https://eject.tech). Have questions or want to chat to us about the project? Reach out to us on Twitter [@geteject](https://twitter.com/geteject) or use our contact form [eject.tech/contact](https://eject.tech/contact).

**These tools are still in active development and subject to a first release, there will be ongoing breaking changes until then. Sign up to our waitlist at [eject.tech](https://eject.tech) to be notified of product updates.**

## Eject Interface

The Eject CLI is a command-line interface for developing and building Eject applications and publishing generated packages. Its goals are simple:

- Make it easy to spin-up top quality APIs with any language and framework, via our stubs.
- Provide a common interface for any language or framework to integrate with.
- Simplify the process of generating and publishing packages, documentation, and specifications.

### Work in progress

We're still working on these tools! Sign up to our waitlist at [eject.tech](https://eject.tech) to be notified of product updates.
