This package is part of a wider suite of open-source API tools which power the Eject platform and correspondingly developed Eject applications. They encourage faster and stricter API development in accordance with our engineering mantra of "build with, not on".

Want to know more about the Eject platform and how it can help you collaboratively build best in class APIs? Head over to [eject.tech](https://eject.tech). Have questions or want to chat to us about the project? Reach out to us on Twitter [@geteject](https://twitter.com/geteject) or use our contact form [eject.tech/contact](https://eject.tech/contact).
